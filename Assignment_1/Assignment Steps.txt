1. Load the Dataset: Import the dataset into a DataFrame.

2. Initial Exploration: Preview the first few rows to understand the structure and contents.

3. Inspect Data Types: Check the data types of columns to ensure they are correctly formatted.

4. Check for Missing Values: Identify any missing data and handle it accordingly (e.g., removal or imputation).

5. Check for Duplicates: Look for and remove duplicate rows if they exist.

6. Descriptive Statistics: Generate basic statistics (mean, median, min, max, etc.) to understand the data distribution.

7. Drop Unnecessary Columns: Remove irrelevant columns that do not contribute to analysis or modeling.

8.Convert Categorical Data: Encode categorical variables (e.g., using one-hot encoding) to prepare them for machine learning models.

9. Feature Engineering: Create new features (e.g., extract year, month, day from date columns).
